# COVID-19 Outbreak Analysis and Prediction

Our project is aimed at discovering potential factors and traits associated with COVID-19. This article intends to apply the machine learning models simultaneously with the forecast of expected reachability of the COVID-19 overthe nations by using the real-time data from the Johns Hopkins dashboard.

Our environment is under the control of the COVID-19 virus. This project is intended to employ the machine learning models for pandemic analysis through a dataset from Johns Hopkins. 

# About the Dataset

- Retrieved from the official repository of JohnsHopkins University.
- Data consists of daily case reports and dailytime series summary tables.
- Selected time-series summary tables in CSV format having three tables for confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 with six properties.

# How it works

- Collects real time data from the John Hopkins Database. 
- Process the data to hand it over to the algorithm.
- Model training from the data.
- Model is trained and it is ready to be used.
